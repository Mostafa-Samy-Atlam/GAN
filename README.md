# GAN
The codes above are implementing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) using pytorch:
  A code for implementing GAN with 2D CNN layers and 2D Batch Normalization.
  The second one is a code for implementing GAN with 2D CNN layers and 2D Spectral Normalization.
  The third one is a code for implementing GAN with Linear layers and 1D Batch Normalization.
  The forth one is a code for implementing GAN with Linear layers and withput 1D Batch Normalization.
  The fifth file is a code implementing spectral normalization.
